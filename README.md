# design-patterns
A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a common software design problem. It represents a way of solving a problem that has been proven to work well in practice, and that can be adapted to different contexts and situations. Design patterns provide a common language and a shared understanding among developers about how to solve certain design problems.

Design patterns are important for several reasons:

    Improving code quality: Design patterns help improve the quality of code by providing a well-defined and tested solution to a design problem. They promote best practices and can help prevent common mistakes.

    Code reuse: Design patterns can be reused in different projects, making it easier and more efficient to write new code. This can save time and effort in the long run.

    Communication: Design patterns provide a common language and shared understanding among developers. This makes it easier for team members to communicate and work together on a project.

    Maintainability: Using design patterns can make code easier to maintain and modify. They provide a clear structure and make it easier to understand how different components of a system interact with each other.

    Scalability: Design patterns can help make a system more scalable by providing a modular, flexible design that can be easily extended and adapted to changing requirements.
    
Below are some examples of design patterns that I wrote, while they are divided into 3 types:

Creational Patterns: Singleton, Factory.

Structural Patterns: composition, Decorator.

Behavioral Patterns: Observer
